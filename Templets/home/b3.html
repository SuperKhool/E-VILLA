        <h1 style="background-color: cadetblue;">WHAT IS PYTHON</h1>
        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it a great language for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
    <h1 style="background-color: cadetblue;">HERE IS SOME KEY FUTURE OF PYTHON </h1>
    1. Simple syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and understand, with a focus on readability. It uses whitespace to define code blocks instead of curly braces or other delimiters, which makes the code look more organized and simpler to understand.<br><br>
2. Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, and more. It has a vast range of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform various tasks.<br><br>
3. Open-source: Python is an open-source language, which means that it is free to use, distribute, and modify. It has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth and development.<br><br>
4. Cross-platform: Python can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also has a large number of libraries and frameworks that are compatible with different operating systems.<br><br>
5. Extensive standard library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks such as file I/O, networking, and data structures. It also has a large number of third-party libraries that can be easily installed using pip, the Python package manager.<br><br>
6. Dynamic typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. This makes it easier to write code and reduce the amount of boilerplate code.<br><br>
7. Object-oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports concepts such as
